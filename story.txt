A long long long time ago, there was a princess.

Middle by Hongru Zhou:
The princess was so beautiful that no one passing by can help themselves from peeking her and admiring her beauty. The rumors of the princess's beauty spread across mountains and seas to a little kindom that only had one prince and two guards. The prince decided to visit the beauty even though the princess's kindom was far away from his own.

No matter how vast the sea is, they went on their journey and never feared to fight the waves.
On top of the the mountains surrounding by clouds, they befriend the stars.
Traveling and traveling. Miles after miles. 
They finally reached the kingdom where it is said that the princess was living in.
But it turned out that it was a lie and there was no princess at all.
Instead, there was a prince who is so handsome that even men will admit it.
The traveling prince immediately fell in love with him and that was another story for the other day.
