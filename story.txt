A long long long time ago, there was a princess.

Middle by Hongru Zhou:
The princess was so beautiful that no one passing by can help themselves from peeking her and admiring her beauty. The rumors of the princess's beauty spread across mountains and seas to a little kindom that only had one prince and two guards. The prince decided to visit the beauty even though the princess's kindom was far away from his own.
